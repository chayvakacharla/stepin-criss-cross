The crisscross game is a two player game where each player has their own tokens namely, X and O, of which one of the player would be chosen by the user prior the game and the other will be the computer bot. Just navigate to implementation folder and "make run" to play.

The goal of the user is to get a Three in a row before the computer inputs do at:

Any of the horizontal rows
Any of the vertical rows
Any of the diagonal rows
The user would be prompted with a message depicting whether the user won, lost or the match be a draw.

Note : Ignore the warnings shown while executing (they are not errors, the program will work fine), those are just the warnings for too much words returning from the function, which is only used for test purposes, not a part of the actual program.
